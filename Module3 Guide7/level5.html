<!DOCTYPE html> <!-- declaration defines the document type and version of HTML  -->
<html lang="en"> <!--   It wraps all the content of the page and pecifies that the document is in English--> 
<head> <!-- contains meta-information about the document, such as its title--> 
    <meta charset="UTF-8"> <!-- supports a wide range of characters-->
    <title>Hello World</title> <!-- title -->
</head> <!--contains meta-information about the document, such as its title-->
<body> <!-- element contains the content of the web page-->
    <h1 id="greeting"></h1> <!-- heading -->

    <!- - <!--  opening of comment tag-->
    Now comes the first thing we have never seen before, namely TypeScript.
    Try to read it and guess what it does, write in a comment what you think it will do
    Next use Google, ChatGPT and/or Claude to find out what it does.
    write in another comment what it actually does and see if it is far from what you thought it did
    - -> <!-- closing of the comment tag -->
    <script> <!--define client-side scripts  -->
        document.getElementById("greeting").innerHTML = "Hello, world!"; <!-- is a method of the document object that retrieves an HTML element based on its id attribute -->
    </script> <!--  closing tag-->
</body> <!-- closign tag -->
</html> <!--  closign tag-->
